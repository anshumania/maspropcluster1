This folder contains:

- menu-options.jpg       - The menu options that will be available
- welcome-screen.jpg     - The blank screen at welcome at present. In the future this will probably 
                           be loaded with a default sudoku.
- sudoku-gui-currentAndProposed.jpg - This screen shows the current state of the sudokuGUI i.e. a proper
                                       9x9 sudoku with givens and hidden cells. The proposed part shows
                                       that the zones and cells will have clear demarcations.
