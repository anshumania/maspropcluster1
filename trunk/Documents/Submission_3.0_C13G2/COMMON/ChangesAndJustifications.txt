1. Matrix is now a shared class
   Previously the SudokuApplication was considering using only a doubly-linked list to implement their alogrithm and Hidato a double dimensional array. However as it turns out , the SudokuAlgorithm works fine also with a double dimensional array and hence the design decision was taken to move the Matrix up to a shared level.

2. StatisticsManager
   changed getStatistics to return java.util.Properties instead of List<String>
   - The scores and names are key value pairs and java.util.Properties provides the appropriate functions to stream to and load directly from a property file and no need to add another layer to manage scores. We re-use the inbuilt functionality provided by the JDK.
   
   added getScoreFor(Game game)
   - execution functionality to calculate and fetch the score for a game

   added isAHighScore(Double score)
   - to check whether the score scored by the user is actually a highScore

   added addAHighScore(Double score, String name)
   - to add a particular user withn name : name who has got a highScore : score

   

3. GUIManager
 - added abstract method gameOver function
   execution functionality when a game gets over. The exit() method is used for clean up operations when the Application exits and a control was required at a game level.
 
 - added getHelp()
   functionality to execute when user requests the manual
