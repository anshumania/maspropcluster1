This is a very short introduction to representing Sudoku as a DancingLinks problem
Kindly refer to SudokuDLX.xlsx for the below details.

This example refers to a 4x4 Sudoku and can be extended to any NxN sudoku

A sudoku Dancing Links matrix is a constraint problem which can be solved by satisfying the following four constraints

1. Each of the N cells has to be filled by one number from 1-N.   NxN
2. Each of the Rows has to be filled by one number from 1-N.      NxN
3. Each of the Columns has to be filled by one number from 1-N.   NxN
4. Each of the zones has to be filled by one number from 1-N.     NxN

Thus there are NxNX4 Columns in the Sudoku Dancing Links Matrix

Rows are the possible positions for each possible number
 a. possible positions (cells) = NxN
 b. possible numbers           = N

Hence there are NxNxN rows in the sudoku Dancing Links Matrix

The math involved is this 

To put information 
------------------------------------------
i is the value put in
4 columns group: <r,c> <i,r> <i,c> <i,b>
1 : r*N+c
2 : (N*N) + r*N + i 
3 : (2*N*N) + c*N + i 
4 : (3*N*N) + b*N + i
--------------------------------------------------
Retrieving row informations
for the rows in solution rows
i=row%N
c=(row/N)%N
r=row/(N*N)





-------------------Other Game Details-----------------------

For a 9x9 sudoku 

In Game Generation the above game solver and validator is used to generate valid sudoku games.
If a difficult game is to be generated then the number of givens placed in the sudoku are 30 and then 4000 random
generations are created and tested for validity or uniqueness of solution. It has been taken into account that the random
generations have numbers placed according to Sudoku rules hence bringing down the time drastically.
After 4000 generations the number of givens is incremented by 1, i.e 31 and then 4000 generations are tried again.
It goes on till a valid Sudoku is found usually around by givens 34. 
For Medium Level the iteration for generations is placed at 3000 with givens at 40 and for Easy the givens are 45
and the number of iterations are 1500.

The Extreme level sudokus with 17 givens take a long time to generate and are pre-generated and randomly loaded.
