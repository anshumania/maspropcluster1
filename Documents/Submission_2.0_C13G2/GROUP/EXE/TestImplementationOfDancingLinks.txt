2. Test a 2d dlx that has 1 solution  			public void testCreateDlxAndSolve2dSolution() 
3. Test a 3d dlx that has 0 solution  			public void testCreateDlxAndSolve3dNoSolution() 
4. Test a 3d dlx that has solutions test for 1 solution public void testCreateDlxAndSolve3dSolutions() 
5. Test a 4d dlx that has more than 1 solution 	        public void testCreateDlxAndSolve4dSolutions() 
6. Stress test dlx matrix for a 			public void testCreateDlxAndSolve9x9SudokuSparseMatrix()
	9x9 sudoku implies 729 rows 
	and 324 columns.
	for simplicity sake
	assume the matrix to be of the form 
	"1,1,0,0,0,...... 
	 0,0,1,0,0,......
	 0,0,0,1,0,......
	 0,0,0,0,1,......
	 ..
	 ...
	 0,0,0,0,0,.....1
	 For such a matrix there will exist only 1 solution
	i.e one solution to the exact cover problem
